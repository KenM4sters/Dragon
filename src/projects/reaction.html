                Reaction is a simple Physics library intended to be used for efficient 
                collision detection and resolution in 2D games.

                This is my most recent project, and is currently undergoing lots of
                modifications as I learn more about the complex space of integrating 
                realistic collisions within video games at an acceptable frame rate.

                I have huge plans for this project as I hope to develop it to the point 
                where it can be used in, relatively simple, physics simulations that involve interactions
                such as stacking, cloth and rope physics.
