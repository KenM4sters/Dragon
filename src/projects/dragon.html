                Dragon is a 3D PBR renderer written in Typescript using WebGL.

                Even though I generally prefer working with systems languages like C and C++, 
                ultimately I want to bring video games to as many people as possible, and no platform
                is as widely suppport as the web.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                I'm by no means a web developer, but I do really enjoy developing with different
                technologies to the ones that I'm used to, and I've found that working with 
                Typescript and WebGL is (generally...) very pleasing. 
            </p1>
            <p1>
                I've also taken a look into WebGPU and plan on giving it more time once it's 
                supported on more browsers.
