                Dragon is a 3D PBR renderer written in Typescript using WebGL.

                Even though I have more experience using systems langauges like C and C++, I do really
                enjoy exploring the realm of fullstack web development in TS using frameworks like React and Node, as well
                as databases such as PostgreSQL. After all, this is where my jounrey in computer programming
                began in the first place.

                Being able to combine my passion for graphics rendering with web develoment through WebGL and more recently
                WebGPU is an amazing luxury that I look forward to exploring more over time.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                I've developed a few fullstack applications over the past few months that can all be found at my 
                gtihub profile under the respective repository.
