                Reaction is a simple physics library intended to be used for efficient 
                collision detection and resolution in 2D games. 
            </p1>

                This is my most infant project and is currently undergoing lots of
                modifications as I learn more about the complex space of integrating 
                realistic collisions within video games at an acceptable frame rate.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                I have huge plans for this project as integrating realistic mechanics 
                into a graphics application, whether it be a physics-specific simulation or a 
                video game, has always been a huge ambition of mine. I plan on giving it 
                much more time once my largest project, Mammoth, is in a more suitable condition
                to be sidelined, and hope to achieve some interesting dynamics such as rope and 
                cloth.
