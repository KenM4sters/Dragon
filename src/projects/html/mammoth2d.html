                Mammoth is a an api-agnostic, object-oriented rendering framework desgined to provide a simplified, yet functional 
                and peformant wrapper around OpenGL and Vulkan, with DX12 and Metal support planned for the future.

                I've always enjoyed developing game engines like my PBR renderer and 3D Sandbox World, but ultimately the part that
                I find the most interesting about game development is the configuring the graphics pipeline and writing
                shader programs to produce sensational effects with as little overhead as possible. 
            </p1>
            <p1>
                This is currently my largest project and is under-going heavy refactoring as continue
                to find the right balance of abstraction and flexibility.
